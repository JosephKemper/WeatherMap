# Overview

My initial goal for creating this project was simply to showcase both what I can learn and what I am capable of. As I started to create the idea for what I wanted to do, I realized that I could easily use it to help better plan a trip I will be taking in December 2023. I will be traveling to Idaho in December to graduate and having a dedicated weather app to use for the whole area between where I live and Idaho would be nice. So, the big goal of this project is to help better plan my trip as well.
