# Overview

This project provides the foundation for a weather and travel map that will help you plan for longer trips. In this case it pulls from major landmarks along the path and then gets the current weather from the National Weather Service for each selected landmark along the path, and displays the 7-day forecast and any weather alerts for the area around the landmark.

* Allow for custom starting points
* Allow for custom destinations
* Find routs to and from the destination
* Automatically find major landmarks along the way
* Get weather info for the landmarks that were found.
